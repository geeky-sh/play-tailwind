                    I have 11 years of experience in building consumer-facing products from scratch & scaling them.
                    My forte lies in designing products in a robust and configurable manner with considerable focus
                    on database design which can later help derive insights. I believe in coming up with simple but
                    complete solutions to problems. <br/>
                    In addition, I have built and managed a team of engineers (~15), guided & helped them hone their skills.
                    And have led the team to build scalable, modular and extensible products within stipulated timelines.
